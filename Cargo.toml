# This is also necessary in `wheel/Cargo.toml` to make sure the `wheel` crate builds as well.
# This overrides the crates.io version of `clvm-traits` with the local version.
# This is because `clvmr` currently uses the latest published version of `clvm-traits`.
# Because path dependencies are considered different from crates.io dependencies, they conflict.
# All of the types are considered different by Cargo, and the below snippet is necessary to fix this.
# When making breaking changes, this may be a complication.
# Ideally this should be removed once a long term fix is found.
